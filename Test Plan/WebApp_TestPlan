## **1. Project Overview**

This test plan defines the strategy, approach, scope, and resources for testing a web application. The purpose is to **validate functionality, usability, responsiveness, and cross-browser compatibility**, and identify defects for resolution.

---

## **2. Objectives**

* Ensure the application functions as intended for all workflows
* Identify usability and functional defects
* Validate compatibility across multiple browsers and devices
* Demonstrate basic automation using Selenium

---

## **3. Scope of Testing**

**In-Scope:**

* Login and Signup workflows
* Forms and submission processes
* Navigation and links
* Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
* Responsive testing (desktop, tablet, mobile)
* Basic automation of login workflow

**Out-of-Scope:**

* Backend performance/load testing
* Security testing beyond basic functionality

---

## **4. Test Approach**

* **Manual Testing:** Execute test cases for all functional and usability scenarios
* **Automation Testing:** Selenium script to validate login functionality
* **Defect Tracking:** Using Jira/GitHub Issues to log, prioritize, and track defects

---

## **5. Entry Criteria**

* Test environment accessible and stable
* Test accounts and test data available
* Test tools installed (Excel/Google Sheets, Jira/GitHub, Selenium)

---
